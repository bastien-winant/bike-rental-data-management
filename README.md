# Bike Rental Data Management
## Problem
The growth team at CitiBike wants to help their analysts understand the effects of weather on bike rentals.
However, they have no data warehouse and no way to build (let alone schedule) data models.
The raw data is split into different files and needs to be transformed into a unified and queryable dataset.

## About the data
This project is centered around usage of rental bikes in New York City. The corresponding dataset is sourced from
Citi Bike's [Data Portal](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data)and includes millions of trip records with start and end times, station locations, bike IDs, and rider types.
For the purposes of this project, I manually downloaded the 2016 monthly archive files.

The data for this project includes millions of bike trip records with start and end times, station locations, bike IDs,
and rider types. It is sourced from Citi Bike's [Data Portal](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data) data portal in
the form of monthly CSV files
