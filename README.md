# Bike Rental Data Management
## Problem
The growth team at Citi Bike wants to help their analysts better understand the effects of weather on bike rentals.
However, they have no data warehouse and no way to build (let alone schedule) data models.
The company has provided a year of bike rental data and weather data has been sourced from the government.
The data must be extracted, transformed, and loaded into a relational PostgreSQL database.
In addition, views should be built to assist the analytics team.

## About the data
The bike rental dataset contains details about individual rides taken on Citi Bike's bikeshare program.
Each record includes exact timestamps and coordinates, as well as basic user attributes.
Citi Bike compiles this information on a monthly basis, and makes it available as publicly downloadable CSV files on
its [data portal](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html). For the purposes of this project,
all files for the year 2016 were downloaded.

The weather data is pulled from the Global Historical Climatology Network daily (GHCNd),
a governmental online database of daily climate recordings. It covers metrics related to temperature,
precipitation, and wind recorded at a weather station in New Jersey.
