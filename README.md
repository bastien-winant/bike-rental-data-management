# Bike Rental Data Management
## Problem
The growth team wants to help their analysts understand the effects of weather on bike rentals.
However, they have no data warehouse and no way to build (let alone schedule) data models.

The aim is to clean and validate both data sets, design a relational PostgreSQL database to store the data,
and develop views for the database to assist the analytics team.
