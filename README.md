# Bike Rental Data Management
## Problem
The growth team at CitiBike wants to help their analysts understand the effects of weather on bike rentals.
However, they have no data warehouse and no way to build (let alone schedule) data models.

The aim is to clean and validate both data sets, design a relational PostgreSQL database to store the data,
and develop views for the database to assist the analytics team.

## About the data
This project is centered around usage of rental bikes in New York City. The corresponding dataset is sourced from
Citi Bike's [Data Portal](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data)and includes millions of trip records with start and end times, station locations, bike IDs, and rider types.
For the purposes of this project, I manually downloaded the 2016 monthly archive files.
