# Bike Rental Data Management
## Problem
The growth team at CitiBike wants to help their analysts understand the effects of weather on bike rentals.
However, they have no data warehouse and no way to build (let alone schedule) data models.
The raw data is split into different files and needs to be transformed into a unified and queryable dataset.

## About the data
The main dataset for this project was sourced from Citi Bike's [Data Portal](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data).
In total, it includes millions of trip records with start and end times, station locations, bike IDs, and rider types,
as well as current station and bike availability. The data is made publicly available as downloadable CSV files going
back to 2013.
